Include with features for post analysis

Position in space
Predict Distance to Failure
Calculate distance metrics
Use set of distances to create features
Use these features in XGBoost
Try and Get reasonable R2 values
Which features best predict distance to failure
Make one model with all data from all experiments
Make models with subsets of data
Differences between clustering in rock types with feature importances, eyeball analysis (homogeneity of fractures?)
Noise filters?
Directional Filters (Sobel? 30 degrees More-Coulomb Theory orientation of maximum coulomb stress (shear stress/normal stress) only close to failure (earlier in loading fractures are vertical))

Get ellipsoids
Describe work so far in the data/method section
Background Sections
Look for papers
200, 300 minimum cluster, or 500 for marble
Every time I read a paper, write ten line summary: purpose, method, result, citation + link
